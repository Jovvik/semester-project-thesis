    This project investigates the application of topological data analysis (TDA)
    to the study of decision boundaries in machine learning classifiers in general,
    and how these boundaries evolve during training in particular.
    Decision boundaries partition the input space into regions corresponding to
    different class labels, and understanding their topology can provide deep
    insights into model behavior, particularly regarding overfitting and
    underfitting. Building upon the Labeled Vietoris-Rips complex framework,
    which was previously limited to binary classification, we extend it to
    handle multiclass classification problems and propose topological metrics
    that can be used to quantify the fitness of a classifier.
