    This project investigates the application of topological data analysis (TDA)
    to the study of decision boundaries in machine learning classifiers.
    Decision boundaries partition the input space into regions corresponding to
    different class labels, and understanding their topology can provide deep
    insights into model behavior, particularly regarding overfitting and
    underfitting. Building upon the Labeled Vietoris-Rips complex framework,
    which was previously limited to binary classification, we extend it to
    handle multiclass classification problems.
