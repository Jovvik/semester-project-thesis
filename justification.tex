\section{Synthetic 2D and 3D data experiments}

\begin{itemize}
    % \item Describe the data (or do it in the methodology?)
    \item Show what isn't captured correctly
    \item Show that CC filtering or the Dowker complex can help
\end{itemize}

In \todo{ref}, we can see that the LVR complex includes edges and triangles that
cross the decision boundary multiple times. This is a problem, because these edges and triangles


\section{Sampling stability on MNIST}

Show that with the default parameters, the persistence diagrams change too much under sampling.
Show it's stable under N=10.
