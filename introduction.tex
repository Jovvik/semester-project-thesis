\section{Background}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ML is cool
    \item TDA is cool
    \item Decision boundaries are cool
    \item Why the intersection of these three may be cool
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives}

Yoink from the proposal.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Explore homological changes in decision boundaries during model training.
    \item Investigate connections between topological features and overfitting/underfitting.
    \item Extend the Labeled Vietoris-Rips complex to multiclass classification.
\end{itemize}
